## Pros and Cons of TDD
### TDD, known as Test Driven Development, has several pros and cons. TDD involves writing tests before developing and start writing more code once those tests are cleared. Some pros of TDD include how it allows you to ensure your product is in the right direction so that at the time of deployment there are no doubts. It also makes the end result more high quality as we focus on testing first and the testing is not rushed. It also works with the Agile Methodology, It is easier to manage and maintain and only necessary code is written. The code written is simple and whatever is needed to actually implement specific features. Overall, it allows for less time spent on debugging which is a huge plus. Moving on to cons, firstly, it is a slower process as you must write tests before you code. The development process is slowed down because of this and writing tests for complex code is a challenge. Also, in the future when changes are made, tests have to be altered and maintained. This is some extra work and effort. Also, TDD may not be suitable for real-world issues like large projects with many constraints.
